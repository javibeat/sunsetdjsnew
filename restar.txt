Steps to restart and work with the project `sunsetdjsnew` on another computer (or after moving to another device):

🚀 PART 1 – COPY THE PROJECT

1. Copy the entire folder `sunsetdjsnew` to a USB or external disk (e.g., T7 Shield).
   From terminal:
     cd /Users/javibeat/Design/Webs/
     cp -R sunsetdjsnew /Volumes/T7\ Shield/

2. On the new computer, paste `sunsetdjsnew` anywhere (recommended: ~/Design/Webs/).

✅ IMPORTANT FILES TO VERIFY AFTER COPYING:
- .env (make sure it's present and configured)
- requirements.txt
- manage.py
- Procfile
- staticfiles/styles.css (must include latest styles)
- core/statics/styles.css (local development)
- templates and core/views.py must match the latest version used

💻 PART 2 – SETUP ON THE NEW COMPUTER

3. Open terminal and go to project folder:
   cd /path/to/sunsetdjsnew

4. Create and activate virtual environment:
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

5. Install project dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Make sure `.env` file is correct. Example content:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=...
   DJANGO_DEBUG=True
   DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost,sunsetdjsnew-production.up.railway.app
   EMAIL_HOST_USER=...
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=...
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
   SITE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
   ```

7. Apply database migrations:
   python manage.py migrate

8. (Optional) Load example data:
   python manage.py loaddata dump.json

9. Collect static files (required for correct CSS display):
   python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

10. Run the Django development server:
    python manage.py runserver

Access: http://127.0.0.1:8000

☁️ PART 3 – PUSH CHANGES TO RAILWAY

11. Make your changes locally (edit views, templates, styles, etc.)

12. Commit and push changes:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update project"
   git push origin main

13. Railway should automatically deploy.

If not, trigger manual deploy from Railway panel (GitHub section > Deploy > Trigger Deploy)

💡 TROUBLESHOOTING STYLES ONLINE

If styles are updated locally but not on Railway:

- Make sure you are editing `core/statics/styles.css`
- Make sure `collectstatic` includes changes (they will appear in `staticfiles/`)
- Ensure this line is in your HTML templates:
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'styles.css' %}?{% now 'U' %}">
- Railway settings:
  - Pre-deploy command: `python manage.py collectstatic --noinput`
  - Gunicorn must point to: `sunsetcore.wsgi:application`

✅ You can now switch computers and continue working exactly where you left off.
